# 👋 Hi, I’m Bruno

## About Me
I’m a **Software Developer** with experience in **Back-End development**, **DevOps**, and **automated testing**. I’m driven by challenges and passionate about high-impact, innovative projects where I can apply and continuously improve my technical skills.

Currently, I work as a freelancer, developing **mobile applications** with **React Native** and designing **scalable, robust APIs** to connect web and mobile platforms. I focus heavily on **unit testing** and **automation** to ensure quality, stability, and maintainability in every project.

My curiosity for technology started early—fascinated by how computers work, I naturally transitioned into programming. Over the years, this passion has evolved into a professional pursuit, constantly pushing me to learn, adapt, and tackle new challenges.

I’m currently seeking a meaningful opportunity as a **Software Developer** in a team that values **innovation**, **continuous learning**, and **technical excellence**.
